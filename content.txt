Lesson 1.2: SHARES

If a stock means you own part of a company, then a share is one specific unit of that ownership. It tells you exactly how much of the company you own. 


Think of a stock as a whole bar of chocolate — owning a share is like owning one square of that bar. If you own 3 squares, you own 3 shares. The more squares you have, the more of the company you own.

Lesson 3.1) Dividend


A dividend is money a company pays to its shareholders from its profits. It’s a way for the company to share its earnings with the people who own its stock.

Imagine a company as a big tree, and your share is like a branch on that tree. When the tree grows fruit, an apple grows on your branch — that apple is your dividend. The more branches (shares) you have, the more apples (dividends) you receive. Just like an apple takes time to grow on a tree, dividends are paid out over time — usually every 3 months.

LESSON 4  - MEASURING COMPANIES
Lesson 4.1) Market Cap

Market cap, or market capitalization, is the total value of a company based on its stock price. You calculate it by multiplying the price of one share by the total number of shares the company has.

Imagine a pizza labeled 'Company' that’s cut into 5 slices. Each slice (share) is selling for $10. If you add up the value of all the slices — 5 slices × $10 — the whole pizza is worth $50. That total value is the company’s market cap.

Lesson 6.1)  Bid-Ask Spread

The bid is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a stock
The ask is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a stock
The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price buyers are offering (bid) and the lowest price sellers are asking for (ask). It shows how much buyers and sellers disagree on the price


Lesson 6.2) Earnings Per Share

EPS tells you how much profit a company makes for each share of its stock. It helps investors understand how profitable the company is

EPS = (Net Income - Dividends)/Total no of shares



Quiz 6.3)

A) $3
 B) $2
 C) $4
 D) $5
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
 EPS = (Net Income - Dividends) / Total Shares = ($10M - $2M) ÷ 4M = $8M ÷ 4M = $2 per share.
(Wait, that's actually $2, so the correct answer is B. Let's fix it.)
Corrected Answer: B
Explanation:
 EPS = (10 - 2) ÷ 4 = 8 ÷ 4 = $2 per share.


Lesson 6.5) P/E Ratio

The P/E ratio shows how much investors are paying for each dollar of a company’s earnings. It helps you tell if a stock is priced high or low compared to how much the company is earning.

P/E Ratio =  Share Price/EPS

Company Stock Price = $100
EPS = $5
P/E Ratio = 100/5 = 20
This means investors are willing to pay $20 for every $1 the company earns.

Higher P/E ( 30-40) means that people are paying a lot for each dollar of profit. 
This may be good because investors believe the company will grow a lot in the future. (e.g., tech companies like Amazon or Tesla).
Risk: You’re paying a premium, so if the company doesn’t grow like expected, the stock might fall.

Lower P/E ( 5-10) means that the stock is cheaper as compared to how much it earns
This may be good because it could be a bargain or be undervalued
Risk: It might be cheap because the company is not growing, is in trouble, or in a declining industry

Quiz 6.6)
If a company’s stock price is $120 and its EPS is $6, what is its P/E ratio?
A) 15
 B) 18
 C) 20
 D) 25
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
 P/E = Price ÷ EPS = 120 ÷ 6 = 20. This means investors are paying $20 for every $1 the company earns.
Quiz 6.7) 
Why can a high P/E ratio be risky?
A) It always means the company is going bankrupt
 B) It shows the company has no earnings at all
 C) It means investors are paying a high price now based on future expectations, which may not come true
 D) It guarantees the company will grow fast
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
 A high P/E means people expect big growth, but if the company doesn’t deliver, the stock price could fall — so it’s not always a safe bet.


Lesson 6.8) Market Order

A market order is when you buy or sell a stock right away at the best price available


Lesson 6.9) Limit Order

A limit order is when you set the exact price you want to buy or sell a stock for. The trade only happens if the stock reaches that price, so you have more control.


Quiz 6.10) 
What is the key difference between a market order and a limit order?
A) A market order lets you set the exact price you want, while a limit order happens immediately
 B) A market order buys or sells right away at the best price, while a limit order waits until your set price is reached

 D) A market order is used only for buying, and a limit order is used only for selling
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
 A market order happens instantly at the best available price, while a limit order gives you control by letting you set the price — but it only goes through if that price is reached.










LESSON 7 - STOCKS AND INDEXES

Lesson 7.1) Stock Index

A stock index is a group of selected stocks used to track the overall performance of a part of the market. It gives you a snapshot of how well companies — or a whole sector — are doing.

Lesson 7.8) Beta(β)

Beta measures how much a stock moves compared to the overall market. It tells you how risky or volatile the stock is.

Beta = 1 → The stock moves the same as the market
Beta > 1 → The stock is more volatile than the market
Beta < 1 → The stock is less volatile than the market
Beta = 0 → The stock doesn’t move with the market (like cash)

Higher the number, the riskier the stock is.

RSI(Relative Strength Index) is a tool that shows whether a stock might be overbought or oversold. It helps traders know if a stock has been going up or down too much, too fast.

RSI is a number between 0 and 100
Above 70 → The stock might be overbought (could go down soon)
Below 30 → The stock might be oversold (could go up soon)

A bull market is when stock prices are going up and people feel confident about investing. It usually means things are going well in the market.
A bear market is when stock prices are falling for a long time and people are worried about the economy. It usually means investors are feeling nervous or unsure.

Bull markets are named after bulls because bulls thrust their horns upward, just like prices rise.
Bear markets are named after bears because bears swipe their paws downward, like prices falling.
It’s all about the direction of the movement — up for bulls, down for bears!

Lesson 11.5) Going long is like planting a seed and waiting for it to grow; going short is like selling fruit before you’ve picked it.

Lesson 11.6) Shorting carries more risk — if the price keeps rising, your losses can be unlimited.

Lesson 11.7) Understanding long vs. short is key to adapting to both rising and falling markets.

Quiz 11.8) 
Why is short selling considered riskier than going long?
A) It requires more stock market experience
 B) You can only short stocks with low volume
 C) The company could sue you
 D) If the stock keeps rising, your losses can be unlimited
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
 With short selling, there's no cap on how high a stock’s price can go — so losses can be much larger than your initial investment.









Lesson 12.1) Day Trading
Day trading means buying and selling a stock within the same day. The goal is to make small profits from short-term price movements before the market closes.

Lesson 12.2) Swing Trading
Swing trading means holding a stock for a few days to a few weeks to profit from short-term price trends. Traders look for bigger moves than day traders but don’t hold positions long term.

Quiz 12.3) 
Which of the following best describes day trading?
A) Buying a stock and holding it for several months
 B) Buying and selling a stock within the same day to profit from small price changes
 C) Buying stocks based only on company fundamentals
 D) Investing in real estate through the stock market
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
 Day trading involves entering and exiting trades within the same day, aiming to capture small price movements before the market closes.

Lesson 12.4) Scalping
Scalping means making many quick trades throughout the day to earn small profits from tiny price changes. Scalpers often hold positions for just seconds or minutes.
Quiz 12.5) 
What is scalping in trading?
A) Holding a stock for a few weeks to catch price swings
 B) Making many very fast trades throughout the day to capture tiny price movements
 C) Buying and holding stocks for the long term
 D) Selling a stock right before an earnings report
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
 Scalping is a rapid trading strategy where traders try to profit from small price changes by making lots of trades within minutes or seconds.

Lesson 12.6) 
Short-term trading requires speed, discipline, and constant attention to news and charts
Longer-term traders focus more on business fundamentals and ignore daily noise

Quiz 12.7) 
How do short-term and long-term traders differ in their approach?
A) Short-term traders ignore market news and focus only on company growth
 B) Long-term traders rely heavily on short-term price patterns
 C) Short-term traders focus on speed, news, and charts; long-term traders focus more on fundamentals and ignore daily noise
 D) Long-term traders usually make trades every few minutes
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
 Short-term traders rely on quick decisions and technical analysis, while long-term investors care more about the company’s long-term potential and financial health.











LESSON 13 - TRADING STRATEGIES

Lesson 13.1) Moving Averages

A moving average is the average price of a stock over a set number of days. It smooths out short-term ups and downs to show the overall trend.

A 50-day moving average shows the average stock price over the last 50 days.
It helps traders see if a stock is generally going up, down, or sideways.

Quiz 13.2)
What does a 50-day moving average show?
A) The number of shares a company has issued
 B) The average stock price over the last 50 days, helping spot trends
 C) The stock’s daily trading volume over 50 days
 D) The company’s profits from the last 50 days
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
 A 50-day moving average gives a smoothed-out view of a stock’s price trend by averaging its price over the last 50 days — helping traders see the overall direction.


Lesson 13.3) MACD

See image

MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence. 
It’s a momentum indicator — a tool used in stock charts to help traders decide when to buy or sell based on the stock’s price movement.
It does this by comparing two moving averages (averages of recent prices):
A fast-moving average (usually 12 days)


A slow-moving average (usually 26 days)
MACD Line = 12-day EMA − 26-day EMA (difference of the two)
 (EMA = Exponential Moving Average, which gives more weight to recent prices)
Signal Line = 9-day EMA of the MACD line
Histogram = The difference between the MACD line and the Signal line (visually shown as bars)
When the MACD line crosses above the Signal line, it’s often a buy signal (momentum is shifting up).
When the MACD line crosses below the Signal line, it’s often a sell signal (momentum is shifting down)
The bars above or below the zero line show how strong the trend is.
Bigger bars = stronger momentum

Quiz 13.4) 

 What does it usually mean when the MACD line crosses above the Signal line?
A) The stock is overvalued and should be avoided
 B) The stock is showing no momentum
 C) It may be a sell signal
 D) It may be a buy signal — momentum is shifting upward
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
 When the MACD line crosses above the Signal line, it often means bullish momentum is building — traders may see it as a buying opportunity.

Quiz 13.5)
What is the Histogram in an MACD chart?
A) A graph showing the total stock volume for the day
 B) A set of bars comparing stock prices across multiple companies
 C) The difference between the MACD line and the Signal line, showing momentum strength
 D) The average of all closing prices over the last 100 days
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
 The histogram shows how far apart the MACD line and Signal line are. Taller bars mean stronger momentum in the stock’s direction.

Lesson 13.6) True Range/ ATR

True Range is the largest of the three: 
1) High of the day − Low of the day
2) High − Previous day’s Close
3) Low − Previous day’s Close
ATR stands for Average True Range.
It’s a volatility indicator — a tool used in stock charts to tell you how much a stock typically moves (up or down) in a day.
It doesn’t tell you direction (like uptrend or downtrend). It just tells you how big the moves are.
ATR is calculated by taking the averages of True Ranges over a period (usually 14 days)
A stock has an ATR of $2.50
 → That means, on average, this stock moves $2.50 per day (up or down).
Another stock might have an ATR of $0.40 — meaning it barely moves daily.

Quiz 13.7)
What does the Average True Range (ATR) tell traders?
A) Whether a stock is in an uptrend or downtrend
 B) The average daily trading volume of the stock
 C) How much a stock typically moves in a day — up or down
 D) The stock’s total price change over the last year
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
 ATR is a volatility indicator — it tells you how much a stock usually moves in a day, not the direction of the move.

Quiz 13.8)
If a stock has an ATR of $3.00, what does that mean?
A) The stock earns $3 in profit every day
 B) The stock gains $3 every day
 C) The stock typically moves about $3 each day, either up or down
 D) The stock has a guaranteed $3 return
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
 An ATR of $3.00 means the stock fluctuates by around $3 per day — it doesn't guarantee gains or losses, just movement.

Lesson 13.9) VWAP
VWAP stands for Volume Weighted Average Price.
It’s a technical indicator that tells you the average price a stock has traded at throughout the day, but it weights that price based on trading volume.
If a stock trades at $100 early in the day and $110 later, but way more people bought at $110, the VWAP will be closer to $110 — not just the average of $100 and $110.
So VWAP shows where most of the money actually traded, not just price movement

VWAP=∑Volume/(∑(Price×Volume)​)
Quiz 13.10)
What does VWAP tell traders?
A) The average price a stock has traded at during the day, weighted by volume
 B) The average stock price over the past 50 days
 C) The highest price a stock reached this week
 D) The total number of trades made during the day
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
 VWAP reflects the true average price where most trading occurred during the day by factoring in trading volume — not just price.

Quiz 13.11)
Why is VWAP more useful than a simple price average?
A) Because it adjusts for how much volume traded at each price
 B) Because it uses closing prices only
 C) Because it predicts future prices
 D) Because it ignores small trades
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
 VWAP gives more weight to prices with higher trading volume, making it more accurate for traders to judge real market interest.

Lesson 13.12) SMA
SMA stands for Simple Moving Average.
It’s one of the most basic and commonly used technical indicators in the stock market.
SMA smooths out price data to help you see the overall direction (trend) a stock is moving in 
If you're using a 20-day SMA, it means you're just averaging the last 20 days of closing prices, and plotting that average on the chart for each day.
A rising SMA suggests the stock is in an uptrend.


A falling SMA suggests a downtrend.


When the stock’s price crosses above the SMA, it could be a buy signal.


When the stock’s price crosses below the SMA, it might be a sell signal.

20-day SMA= (Day 1+Day 2+…+Day 19+Day 20​)/20


Then on Day 21, you drop Day 1 and add Day 21 — always keeping the most recent 20 days in the average.

You can also compare two SMAs:
Example: When the short-term SMA (e.g., 20-day) crosses above the long-term SMA (e.g., 50-day) → that’s called a golden cross (often bullish)


When it crosses below, it’s called a death cross (often bearish)

Quiz 13.13)
What does a rising SMA usually suggest about a stock?
A) The stock is about to split
 B) The stock is in an uptrend
 C) The company is reducing its dividend
 D) The trading volume is low
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
 A rising SMA means the stock’s recent closing prices are increasing — a sign that it’s trending upward.
Quiz 13.14)
Why do traders use a Simple Moving Average (SMA)?
A) To calculate company revenue over time
 B) To find out how much debt a company holds
 C) To track insider trading
 D) To smooth out short-term price movements and spot trends
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
 SMA helps traders see the bigger picture by averaging out recent price data, making it easier to identify trends over time.

Lesson 13.15) 5-Day Change Percentage


The 5-Day Change Percentage tells you how much a stock’s price has gone up or down over the last 5 trading days, expressed as a percentage.
If a stock was $100 five days ago, and it’s $110 now, that’s a +10% change over 5 days.
If it dropped to $95, that’s a −5% change.
It helps you quickly see whether a stock has had a strong week or a weak one, in terms of price movement.



Quiz 13.16)
A stock was priced at $80 five days ago. Today, it's $88. What is the 5-Day Change Percentage?
A) +8%
 B) +10%
 C) −10%
 D) −8%
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Change % = (88-80)/80  X 100 = 8/80 X 100 = 10%
So, the stock has increased by +10% over the past 5 days.
